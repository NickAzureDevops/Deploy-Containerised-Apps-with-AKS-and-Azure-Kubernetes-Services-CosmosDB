# Prerequisites #

We need several prerequisites in this first stage of the lab before continuing. We will show how to set up the Azure DevOps Environment and your backend for Terraform.

- [Azure DevOps Set up](./Azure-DevOps-Setup.md) - This will show you how to set up your Azure DevOps Environment and everything you need to get started with the rest of the lab.

- [Create Terraform Backend](./create-terraform-backend.md) - This will show you how to create your Terraform Backend to store your Terraform State configuration.
