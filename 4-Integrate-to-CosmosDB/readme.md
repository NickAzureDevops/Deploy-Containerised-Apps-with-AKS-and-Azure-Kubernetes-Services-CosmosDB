# Integrate to CosmosDB #

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service that allows you to create and query documents, tables and databases. This lab will integrate the application into CosmosDB. CosmosDB is a NoSQL database that is schemaless. Therefore, this means that you can store any data in the database. The application will be able to store and retrieve data from the database. 

I will be showing you how to integrate the application with CosmosDB. 

- [Cosmosdb Integration](./integrate-cosmosdb.md) gives you an overview of how to integrate the application with a database.
